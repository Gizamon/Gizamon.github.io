People always wonder what i mean by Tabletop enthusiast. well i currently own over 30 tabletop games, play D&D and Magic the Gathering.

i play mostly homebrew with inspirations from settings and have been writing my own world for over 7 years oh how time flies. 

i only play commander when it comes to magic.
